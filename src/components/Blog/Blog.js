                      Here's a quick update: <b>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from UC
                          Irvine!</b> I am incredibly grateful for the four years spent here, and the amazing

                      This year, GHC was held in-person for the first time since the pandemic began. Since UCI
                      is a BRAID school, WICS members had the opportunity to attend GHC in-person or virtually
                      through a scholarship. I attended in-person GHC in Orlando, Florida with about 9 other

                      Ever wondered what UC Irvine students do on a day off? As a student currently attending
