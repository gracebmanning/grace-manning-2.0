                            Irvine!</b> I am incredibly grateful for the four years spent here, and the amazing
                            organizations I was involved with. Of course, shoutout to WICS (Women in Information &

                            This year, GHC was held in-person for the first time since the pandemic began. Since UCI
                            is a BRAID school, WICS members had the opportunity to attend GHC in-person or virtually
                            through a scholarship. I attended in-person GHC in Orlando, Florida with about 9 other
