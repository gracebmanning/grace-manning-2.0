            <br/>Argentinian Horned frogs seem to have been designed for the sole purpose of eating as
            much as possible. They appear to consist of two main parts: a mouth and a stomach. This is
            probably where they got the nickname "PacMan". Their needs are fairly simple, a warm habitat
            in a simple plastic box or aquarium with some shallow water and a few rocks so that they can
            laze around all day suits them just fine. They don't mix well with other frogs, even in
            their own species, as they are just as likely to eat them. <a href="http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">What kind of Frog are <i>you</i>?</a>
